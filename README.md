In 2014, the iWeb containing the Protospace 2.0 lab was [open sourced under the creative commons license on Github](https://www.architectuur.org/nieuwsitem/4416/Afgebroken_iWeb_paviljoen_krijgt_digitaal_derde_leven.html#.VBfol3PsSjo.twitter). It is unfortunately no longer available on the original account but luckily has been forked and still available today. This made it the first Open Source Building, at least on Github. This branch conserves the original fies just in case.
